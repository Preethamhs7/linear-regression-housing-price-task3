# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression

This project implements **simple and multiple linear regression** to predict housing prices using scikit-learn and pandas in Google Colab.

---

## 📌 Objective
Build a regression model to predict house prices using features like area, bedrooms, and location.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Name:** housing.csv  
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Housing Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab

---

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Load and clean dataset  
2. Encode categorical variables  
3. Split into train/test sets  
4. Train using `LinearRegression`  
5. Evaluate using MAE, MSE, R²  
6. Plot regression line and interpret coefficients

---


## 📈 Output
- Visual: Predicted vs Actual prices
- Coefficient interpretation: Shows impact of each feature

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Regression assumptions  
- R² score meaning  
- MAE vs MSE  
- Multicollinearity detection  
- Simple vs Multiple regression
